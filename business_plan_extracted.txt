FOURTH DOWN LABS
The Fantasy Football Terminal
Business Plan & System Design
Solo Founder Edition — Rebuilt from First Principles
Founder: Soham
Version 2.0 • February 2026
CONFIDENTIAL
What Changed From v1
This plan is rebuilt from scratch for a solo founder operating with limited capital, no full-time
engineering team, and a need to reach revenue within 90 days. Every architectural decision has
been stress-tested against the question: can one person build, ship, and maintain this?

===== Page 2 =====
Fourth Down Labs • Business Plan v2.0
PART I
The Honest Assessment
1. What Changed and Why It Matters
The original Fourth Down Labs vision was designed for a four-person founding team. That team
no longer exists. Soham is now the sole founder.
This is not a minor staffing adjustment. It fundamentally changes what can be built, how fast it
can ship, and what the product should even try to be. The original system design called for six
architectural layers, four product modules, three database technologies, Monte Carlo
simulations, an AI chatbot, a creator marketplace, and a React Native mobile app. That plan
assumed 15–20 engineering person-months of work. A solo founder with no external funding
cannot execute that plan on any reasonable timeline.
This document does not scale down the original vision. It replaces it with a new plan designed
from the ground up for the constraints that actually exist. The core market thesis remains strong.
The execution strategy is entirely different.
The Hard Truth
A solo founder building a data-intensive analytics platform is competing against FantasyPros (200+
employees, VC-funded), Fantasy Points (established team, $200+/yr data product), and a sea of free
tools that are good enough for most users. Trying to out-feature these platforms is a losing strategy.
The only viable path is to be radically focused: do one thing so well that word of mouth becomes the
primary growth engine.
2. What Survived the Reassessment
Not everything from the original vision was wrong. Several core insights remain valid and form
the foundation of this rebuilt plan:
• The analogy is strong: The financial analogy is a powerful branding and UX
framework. Treating players as assets, trades as M&A, and the waiver wire as arbitrage
is a genuinely differentiated positioning in a market where every competitor uses the
same generic sports analytics language.
• The trade gap is real: No competitor offers transparent, portfolio-aware trade analysis.
Every trade calculator on the market either (a) adds up opaque player values and
declares a winner, or (b) is free but extremely basic. Nobody shows you how a trade
changes your team’s risk profile, championship odds, or bye-week exposure. This is a
real gap.
• The market is proven: The prosumer segment exists and spends money. The
IBISWorld data shows a $10.3B fantasy sports market growing at 2.45% CAGR through
2030. Fantasy Points charges $200/yr for their data suite and has a viable business.
Page 2

===== Page 3 =====
Fourth Down Labs • Business Plan v2.0
Draft Sharks charges $36–$96/season. There is demonstrated willingness to pay for
analytical edges.
• The data edge is available: Advanced metrics are an unsaturated differentiator. Most
competitors (FantasyPros, Footballguys) offer basic stats. Only Fantasy Points offers
deep advanced data, and they have no trade analyzer or league sync. There is a clear
opportunity to combine advanced analytics with actionable tools.
3. What Got Cut and Why
Original Feature Verdict Reasoning
Creator Marketplace Cut entirely Phase 4 feature that requires a large user base to
function. A classic chicken-and-egg problem. Revisit
only if the platform reaches 50,000+ active users.
Live Draft Assistant Deferred to Year

PART II
The Business Plan
4. The One-Sentence Pitch
Fourth Down Labs
The only fantasy football trade analyzer that shows you how a deal changes your championship
odds, not just your roster’s raw value — powered by the advanced metrics the free tools don’t have.
That is the entire product for launch. Not a terminal. Not a platform. Not a marketplace. A single
tool that does one thing better than anything else on the market: analyze fantasy football trades
with institutional-grade rigor. Everything else — the screener, the dynasty valuator, the draft
assistant — is built later, only after this core product has proven product-market fit and
generated revenue.
5. Target Customer
The target customer is not "all fantasy football players." It is a specific, identifiable segment:
Attribute Profile
Identity The “commissioner” archetype: the person in their league who runs the
league, proposes the most trades, and spends 5–10+ hours per week on
fantasy football
Demographics Male, 25–40, college-educated, household income $60K+, tech-comfortable
League Type Plays in 2–4 leagues, at least one dynasty or keeper league, total league
dues of $100–$1,000+/year
Current Behavior Uses FantasyPros for rankings, FantasyCalc or KTC for trade values, Reddit
(r/fantasyfootball, r/DynastyFF) for discussion, and 2–3 podcasts for analysis
Pain Point Spends significant time aggregating information from 4–6 different free tools
before making a trade decision, still feels uncertain about whether the trade
actually improves their team
Willingness to Pay Already pays for one fantasy subscription ($48–$200/yr) or would pay if
convinced the tool delivers measurable value
Platform Predominantly Sleeper users (skew younger, more engaged, dynasty-heavy)
— this is why Sleeper sync is the priority integration
6. Market Sizing
Page 4

===== Page 5 =====
Fourth Down Labs • Business Plan v2.0
The fantasy sports services industry in the US generated approximately $10.3 billion in revenue
in 2024, with projected growth to $11.9 billion by 2030 (2.45% CAGR, per IBISWorld). However,
this total includes daily fantasy (DraftKings, FanDuel) which represents roughly 40.6% of the
market. The season-long fantasy segment is approximately 45% of the market, or ~$4.6 billion.
Within season-long fantasy, the addressable market for analytics and tools platforms (as
opposed to hosting platforms like Yahoo, ESPN, Sleeper) is a fraction of this. Based on
competitor pricing and estimated user bases:
Segment Estimate Source
Total US fantasy sports market (2024) $10.3 billion IBISWorld
Season-long fantasy segment (~45%) ~$4.6 billion IBISWorld product segmentation
Analytics/tools TAM (estimated) $200M–$500M Sum of competitor revenues +
unmonetized demand
Prosumer segment willing to pay $50–
2–5 million users Based on 40M+ total fantasy
$200/yr
players, ~5–12% prosumer
Fourth Down Labs Year 1 target 2,000–5,000 paid
subscribers
Conservative: $120K–$400K ARR
at $60–80/yr avg
Why This Is Achievable
2,000 paid subscribers at $5/month ($60/year) = $120,000 ARR. Draft Sharks charges $36–$96 per
season. If the trade analyzer is demonstrably better than free alternatives and earns word-of-mouth
in dynasty communities, 2,000 subscribers within 12 months of launch is a realistic target for a
focused product.

PART III
System Design
8. Architecture: Designed for One
The system architecture is designed around a single constraint that overrides all others: one
person must be able to build it, ship it, debug it at 2 AM when something breaks, and still have
time to do customer support and marketing. Every technology choice is evaluated against this
constraint.
The Solo Founder Architecture Test
For every component: (1) Can I set it up in under a day? (2) Can I debug it without a team? (3) Does
it have managed/hosted options so I’m not running infrastructure? (4) Is there a simpler alternative
that gets 80% of the result? If any answer is no, the component is replaced or deferred.
8.1 Technology Stack
Component Choice Why This, Not That
Frontend Next.js (React) —
Server-side rendering for SEO, API routes built-in

(no separate backend for simple endpoints), Vercel
deployment is zero-config. Responsive web serves
as the mobile experience.
Backend / API Next.js API routes +

microservice
analytics (xFP calculations, trade analysis,
valuations). Two services total, not twelve.
Database PostgreSQL (hosted on
One database for everything. Supabase provides
Supabase or Railway)
auth, real-time subscriptions, and a REST API out of
the box. No Redis, no ClickHouse, no operational
burden.
ETL / Data
Python scripts + cron jobs
nflverse data updates weekly during the season. A
Pipeline

Python script that runs on a schedule is infinitely
simpler than Airflow. Upgrade to managed
orchestration only when pipeline complexity
demands it.
ML / Analytics Python (scikit-learn,
OLS regression for xFP models. No PyTorch, no
pandas, NumPy)
model serving infrastructure. The models run as part
of the weekly ETL job and write results to
PostgreSQL.
Auth & Payments Supabase Auth + Stripe Supabase handles user management, sessions, and
row-level security. Stripe handles subscriptions with
minimal code.

===== Page 8 =====
Fourth Down Labs • Business Plan v2.0
Component Choice Why This, Not That
Hosting Vercel (frontend) +
Managed platforms with generous free tiers. No
Railway or Fly.io (Python
AWS console, no Kubernetes, no Docker

orchestration.
Monitoring Sentry (errors) + Vercel
Analytics (traffic)
Free tiers are sufficient. Upgrade to Datadog only
when revenue justifies it.
What Is Deliberately NOT Here
No Redis. No ClickHouse. No Apache Airflow. No Kubernetes. No React Native. No WebSocket
infrastructure. No separate microservices for each module. Each of these is a valid technology for a
funded team, but each one is also a maintenance surface that a solo founder must monitor, debug,
and upgrade alone. They can all be added later if needed.

Fourth Down Labs • Business Plan v2.0
10. The Analytics Engine
10.1 Expected Fantasy Points (xFP) Models
The xFP models are position-specific OLS regressions trained on 3 seasons of historical data.
They are intentionally simple: linear regression is interpretable, fast to train, and easy to debug.
More sophisticated ML models (gradient boosting, neural networks) are a future optimization,
not a launch requirement.
Wide Receivers
Formula: xFP(w) = C0 + C1(TPG) + C2(YPRR) + C3(aDOT) + C4(FD/TGT%) +
C5(RZTGTS/G)
Matchup-Adjusted: Projected FP = xFP(w) × DSM(opponent), where DSM = 1 +
DAF(opponent)
Variables: Targets Per Game (volume), Yards Per Route Run (efficiency), Average Depth of
Target (role), First Down Per Target % (high-leverage efficiency), Red Zone Targets Per Game
(scoring volume). Coefficients determined via OLS, retrained start-of-season and before the
trade deadline.
Running Backs
Key Principle: For RBs, opportunity is king. A target is worth 2.5–3.0x a carry in PPR formats.
The RB model weights rushing attempts, targets (or route share), red zone carries, red zone
targets, routes run per game, and high-leverage snap share. It explicitly models the difference
between a bellcow back (high opportunity, moderate efficiency) and a pass-catching specialist
(lower volume, higher per-touch value).
Identity: Actual FP = xFP (opportunity) + FPOE (skill/luck). This decomposition is the core
insight users care about: is this player producing because he’s good, or because he’s getting
fed volume?
Tight Ends and Quarterbacks
TE model: Hybrid of WR and RB frameworks, weighted heavily toward route share and red zone
usage. QB model: Adjusted completion %, aDOT, rushing contribution, situational context
(Vegas implied totals, opponent pass defense DVOA). QB projections are the least
differentiated part of the product since QB value is more predictable; the real alpha is in
WR/RB/TE analysis.
10.2 Opponent Defensive Strength Multiplier (DSM)
The DSM adjusts a player’s baseline xFP for the specific defense they face that week. It is
calculated per-position: a defense that shuts down WRs may be vulnerable to RBs, and vice
versa. The Defensive Adjustment Factor (DAF) measures how many fantasy points above or
below league average a defense allows to each position, normalized by strength of opposing
Page 12

===== Page 13 =====
Fourth Down Labs • Business Plan v2.0
offenses faced. DSM = 1 + DAF. A DSM of 1.08 means the defense allows 8% more fantasy
points than average to that position; 0.93 means 7% fewer.
10.3 Dynasty Valuation (Simplified for Launch)
The full DCF-style dynasty model from the original plan is deferred. For launch, dynasty values
are calculated using a simpler but effective approach:
• Base value: Rest-of-season xFP projection, weighted by league scoring format
• Age adjustment: Position-specific multiplier based on empirical aging curves (RBs
decline fastest, WRs peak later, TEs have longest windows)
• Trend adjustment: 3-season weighted FPOE trend (ascending players get a premium,
declining players get a discount)
• Market comparison: Value gap between the calculated intrinsic value and FantasyCalc’s
crowdsourced market value, flagging buy-low/sell-high opportunities
This simplified model captures 80% of the value of the full DCF approach while being buildable
in days rather than months. The full DCF model (with injury-adjusted discount rates and
contract-situation factors) is a Phase 2 upgrade.

11. The Product: Trade Analyzer
This is the only product that matters at launch. Everything else is built on top of it. The trade
analyzer must be best-in-class on day one or the platform fails.

12. Phase 2 Products (Post-Revenue)
These products are built only after the Trade Analyzer is live, has paying subscribers, and has
validated product-market fit. They are listed here for roadmap clarity, not as launch
commitments.
12.1 The Market Screener
A multi-factor player screening tool that lets users query the entire player database using any
combination of standard and proprietary metrics. The Capital IQ screener equivalent. Users
build complex filters (e.g., “All WRs under 26 with target share > 22% and aDOT > 12”) and
save them as watchlists with optional alerts. The data infrastructure for this already exists in the
Master Player Database; the Screener is primarily a frontend and query layer.
12.2 Dynasty Valuator (Full)
Upgrade from the simplified age-adjusted model to the full DCF-style valuation engine. Adds
draft pick pricing (as options contracts with moneyness based on team performance), historical
value charts, and automated Player Research Reports with buy/sell/hold ratings. The Monte
Carlo championship simulation is added here to power the Trade Terminal’s championship
equity delta feature.
12.3 AI-Assisted Analysis
Evolution from intelligent search to a conversational AI that can answer natural language
questions (“Should I trade Breece Hall for Ja’Marr Chase?”) using RAG grounded in the Master
Player Database. Phase 1 delivers 80% of this value through a smart search bar that
understands player names, metric requests, and comparison queries without requiring a full
LLM pipeline.
12.4 Live Draft Assistant
The most complex product module, requiring real-time websocket connections to draft
platforms, sub-second value recalculation, and opponent modeling. Deferred until the data
infrastructure and projection models are battle-tested from a full season of Trade Analyzer
usage. Expected timeline: ready for the 2027 draft season.

The Key Insight: Ship the Free Tool at Week 10
The free trade analyzer launches before monetization is built. This is deliberate. The first 2–4 weeks
of the free tool being live are for collecting user feedback, fixing bugs, and building word of mouth.
Monetization goes live at week 12 after the product has been validated by real users.

With no marketing budget and no team, growth must be organic. The strategy focuses on three
channels where a solo founder with a superior product can compete:
15.1 Reddit and Discord (Community-Led)
The dynasty fantasy community lives on Reddit (r/DynastyFF, r/fantasyfootball) and Sleeper’s
Discord servers. These communities are highly engaged, skeptical of marketing, and responsive
to genuinely useful tools. The strategy is not to spam links. It is to become a valuable
community member who happens to have built a tool:
• Post original analytical content using Fourth Down Labs data (e.g., “I analyzed every WR
trade from the last 3 months. Here’s which side won based on rest-of-season
production.”)
• Answer trade questions with screenshots of the tool’s output, showing the analysis
framework
• Run weekly “Ask me to analyze your trade” threads during the season
• Offer Pro access to subreddit moderators and community leaders
15.2 SEO (Search-Driven)
Fantasy football trades generate enormous search volume during the season. Target long-tail
keywords that existing competitors underserve:
• Player-specific trade queries: “Should I trade [Player A] for [Player B] fantasy football”
• Trade value queries: “What is [Player] worth in fantasy football trade”
• Format-specific queries: “Dynasty trade analyzer PPR”, “Superflex trade calculator”

Each of these queries maps directly to the trade analyzer. The free tool serves as the SEO
landing page; conversion to Pro happens after the user sees the value of the analysis.
15.3 The Screenshot Effect (Viral)
The trade report’s Verdict section is designed to be screenshotted and shared. When a user
shares their trade grade in a group chat, the Fourth Down Labs brand is visible to 10–12
league-mates, each of whom is a potential user. This is the lowest-cost, highest-leverage
growth channel available. It requires no marketing spend — only a product good enough that
people want to share it.

Infrastructure costs are nearly irrelevant compared to potential revenue. The business breaks
even on infrastructure with approximately 15–20 paid subscribers. The real cost is Soham’s
time. At the base case scenario of $210K ARR, Fourth Down Labs is a sustainable one-person
business that funds its own growth.

PART V
The Path Forward
19. What This Plan Is (and Isn’t)
This plan is not a scaled-down version of the original Capital IQ vision. It is a fundamentally
different approach designed for a fundamentally different situation. The original plan assumed a
team, assumed funding, and assumed the ability to build multiple products simultaneously. This
plan assumes none of those things.
What this plan does assume: that Soham can write code, that the fantasy football prosumer
market exists and is willing to pay for demonstrably better tools, that the trade analyzer is the
highest-leverage entry point into that market, and that word of mouth in tight-knit fantasy
communities can drive growth without a marketing budget.
The Capital IQ vision is not abandoned. It is the destination. But the route to get there is one
product at a time, each one proving its value before the next is built. The trade analyzer is the
beachhead. The screener extends the territory. The dynasty valuator and draft assistant
complete the terminal. The creator marketplace is the endgame.
But none of that matters if the trade analyzer isn’t great. So that’s what gets built first.
20. Soham’s 14-Day Sprint Plan
The following is the concrete, actionable plan for the next two weeks. No architecture diagrams.
