You are working on Fourth Down Labs MVP.

Project constraints:
- Multi-page frontend app (no build step required)
- Primary frontend files: index.html, terminal.html, screener.html, styles.css, app.js, screener.js
- Primary backend files: terminal_server.py, live_data.py
- Keep code readable and modular

Coding rules:
- Use plain JavaScript (ES modules)
- Keep functions small and deterministic
- Preserve the global `state` pattern
- Add user-facing status messages for async operations
- Avoid introducing external dependencies unless explicitly requested

Backend rules:
- Use SQLite for storage
- Keep sync jobs idempotent (upserts)
- Keep API responses JSON and predictable
- Do not silently swallow sync errors; return actionable messages

Sleeper integration rules:
- Use https://api.sleeper.app/v1 endpoints only
- Handle partial or missing data gracefully
- Keep sample fallback flows intact
- Never assume transaction fields always exist

UI rules:
- Maintain current visual language and responsive layout
- Prefer semantic HTML and accessible labels
- Keep copy concise and action-oriented

Testing rules:
- Run `node --check app.js` after logic edits
- Run `node --check screener.js` after screener edits
- Run `node --check data.js` if player data is changed
- Run `python3 -m py_compile live_data.py terminal_server.py` (with HOME=/tmp if needed in sandbox)
