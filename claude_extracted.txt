Fourth Down Labs: technical feasibility, market, and distribution research
Building a dynasty fantasy football "adversarial intelligence" SaaS is technically feasible, competitively
differentiated, and has a clear distribution path — with an estimated MVP cost under $80/month. The
Sleeper API exposes all the raw data needed (FAAB bids, trade history, roster moves, draft picks) without
authentication, nflverse provides free NFL statistical data under a commercial-friendly license, and no
competitor has automated the leaguemate behavioral analysis that experienced dynasty players already do
manually. The addressable market sits at roughly 1.5–3 million active dynasty players on Sleeper alone,
concentrated in a single highly engaged subreddit (192K members) GummySearch
that rewards tool-sharing.
The Sleeper API gives you everything — for free
The Sleeper API ( api.sleeper.app/v1/ ) requires no authentication, no API keys, and no OAuth. It is entirely
read-only and free, with a rate limit of 1,000 requests per minute. sleeper Sleeper
All responses are JSON.
This is the foundation of the entire product.
The endpoints that matter most for adversarial intelligence are the transaction endpoint
( /league/{id}/transactions/{week} ), which returns every completed trade, waiver claim, and free agent pickup
with full detail. For FAAB waivers, the response includes settings.waiver

bid showing the exact dollar amount

The roster endpoint returns each team's full player list, starters, IR, and
critical metadata like waiver

Dynasty league history traversal works through the previous

league
id field — each season creates a new
_
league ID but chains to the prior year. Recursing this chain gives you complete multi-season behavioral data
for every manager: years of FAAB bids, trade patterns, draft tendencies, and roster decisions. This is the raw
material for adversarial profiling that no one has systematized.
Key limitations to design around: rejected/cancelled trade offers are invisible (only completed transactions
appear), there is no chat data, no live scoring feed, and no write operations. The massive /players/nfl endpoint
(~5MB) should be cached daily. sleeper Go Packages
Undocumented endpoints at api.sleeper.com (no /v1/
prefix) expose player stats and projections but could break without notice GitHub
— use nflverse as the reliable
stats backbone instead.
nflverse delivers production-grade NFL data under open licensing
The nflverse ecosystem is the de facto standard for open NFL analytics, GitHub
providing play-by-play data
back to 1999 nflfastR nflfastR
with 370+ columns per row and ~48,000 plays per season. Python access is

One important gap: true
"routes run" data is not publicly available — you would need PFF (paid) or approximate it from
participation data joined to pass plays. Participation data itself has been delayed to post-season release since
2023. The injury data source died after the 2024 season with no replacement announced.

One direct competitor exists, but execution is shallow
The dynasty tools landscape reveals a clear white space. Dynasty Dealmaker is the only product attempting
leaguemate behavioral analysis, offering basic "Owner Psychology" profiling and AI-powered trade suggestions
Dynastydealmaker
via a token system ($1.49/week, ~$6/month). Their "Dynasty Wrapped" report card went viral
on Reddit (831 upvotes). Dynastydealmaker
But their implementation is surface-level — basic pattern
identification without deep FAAB analysis, draft tendency modeling, or multi-season behavioral profiling.
The established players occupy different niches and leave the adversarial space unaddressed:

Truth in Leaguemate Tendencies" in 2024 advocating for handwritten notebooks. Footballguys
Fourth Down
Labs would automate what the most sophisticated dynasty players already do by hand.
The pricing sweet spot is $5–8/month based on the competitive landscape. A freemium model with basic league
analysis free and adversarial intelligence gated at $6–8/month aligns with DynastyNerds ($5–7/month) and
Dynasty Dealmaker (~$6/month) while offering a differentiated feature set.
Distribution runs through 192K engaged dynasty managers on Reddit
The r/DynastyFF subreddit has approximately 192,000 members GummySearch
with consistently high activity
GummySearch GummySearch
year-round — a critical differentiator from r/fantasyfootball (3.4M members but
seasonal). Dynasty managers trade, evaluate prospects, and manage rosters 12 months a year,
Tech Glides
creating sustained demand for tools.
Content that performs best: original data-driven analysis, tool announcements from authentic community
members, and player evaluation deep dives. A Sleeper employee's product update post received 457 upvotes
and 194 comments, Paulrosenzweig
demonstrating that tool promotion succeeds when the poster is transparent,
the product solves real pain points, and the account has genuine community history. Free tools and original
analysis are received far better than paid pitches.
The distribution playbook: spend 2–3 months contributing genuine analysis (using Fourth Down Labs' own
analytical framework) before launching. Share specific adversarial insights — "I analyzed 10,000 FAAB
transactions and here's what I found about bidding psychology" — as standalone posts. This builds credibility

and generates organic demand. The community explicitly asks for better trade analysis, roster evaluation tools,
and league-specific insights.
Sleeper's platform demographics support the market thesis. The platform has 5–6 million users with 5
million MAU, Skypage Sportico Tracxn
valued at $400 million after raising $67.3 million (led by Andreessen
Horowitz). Sleeper
Sleeper is the undisputed #1 platform for dynasty leagues — while only ~15% of all fantasy
players use Sleeper, Skypage
dynasty/keeper leagues likely represent 30–50% of their leagues. That implies
1.5–3 million active dynasty managers on Sleeper alone. The user base skews young (18–39), tech-savvy, and
highly engaged with 75% retention CanvasBusinessModel Sportico
and 20–40 minute sessions. These are exactly
the users who would pay $6–8/month for a competitive edge.
The solo-founder stack: Next.js, Supabase, Vercel, and AI copilots
The consensus 2025 solo-founder SaaS stack is battle-tested and optimized for AI-assisted development:
Core stack: Next.js 15+ (App Router) with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, deployed on Vercel ($20/month
Pro), with Supabase for PostgreSQL database, authentication, and edge functions (free tier → $25/month).
Payments via Stripe (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction). Background data pipelines through Inngest (free tier →
$25/month) for orchestrating Sleeper API pulls, stat updates, and LLM analysis jobs with built-in retries and
throttling.
This specific combination is optimal because React/TypeScript has the largest AI training corpus — both
Claude Code and Cursor produce their highest-quality code for this stack. Claude Code excels at autonomous
multi-file operations ("build the entire Sleeper API integration layer"), while Cursor handles day-to-day
autocomplete and quick fixes. Using both together, a solo developer can realistically build and ship an MVP in
4–8 weeks.
Visualization uses Recharts via Tremor Tremor
components — pre-styled dashboard elements (KPI cards,
sparklines, trend charts) that save weeks of design work. For the fantasy football context: line charts for player
value trends, radar charts for player profiles, bar charts for leaguemate FAAB patterns.
Estimated monthly infrastructure costs:
Stage Users Monthly cost
MVP 0–100 $60–80
Growth 100–1,000 $120–200
Scale 1,000+ $250–400

===== Page 5 =====
The key architectural decision is the CLAUDE.md / .cursorrules configuration file documenting project
structure, naming conventions, database schema, and coding standards. This is the single highest-leverage
investment for AI-assisted development — both tools reference it continuously to maintain consistency.
LLM costs stay manageable with a three-layer strategy
The adversarial intelligence features require LLM integration for natural-language insights, but costs can be
controlled to $0.30–1.50 per user per month through model routing, caching, and pre-computation.
Model routing by task complexity handles 60–70% of cost optimization alone. Data summarization and
simple player lookups route to GPT-4o mini ($0.15/$0.60 per million tokens) Price Per Token
($1/$5). Anthropic nOps
Standard trade analysis and player evaluations use Claude Sonnet ($3/$15). or Claude Haiku
Only
flagship "deep strategy" reports and complex multi-team trade analyses justify premium models. This tiered
approach routes ~70% of requests to the cheapest tier.
Three-layer caching compounds the savings. First, Anthropic's prompt caching stores static system prompts
and league context Claude API Docs Anthropic at 90% input cost reduction on cache hits
Mobisoft Infotech
Anthropic
— structure prompts with cached league settings and few-shot examples first, dynamic trade data last.
Second, Redis/Upstash exact-match caching stores full responses keyed by prompt hash with TTLs aligned to
data freshness (24 hours for player evaluations, 1 week for league-wide analysis, per-combination for trade
analysis). Third, optional semantic caching via vector similarity can catch rephrased versions of the same
question.
Upstash
Pre-computation is the biggest lever. Generate 60–70% of insights as background jobs — weekly power
rankings, adversarial reports on every opponent, player value updates — using the Batch API at 50% discount
from both Anthropic and OpenAI. Store results in Postgres, serve instantly. Only trade evaluations, custom
scenarios, and follow-up questions need real-time LLM calls with streaming responses.
The architecture for real-time analysis follows a structured RAG pattern: retrieve the specific league's scoring
settings, relevant player stats, roster compositions, and transaction history from Postgres, inject into the prompt
with XML tags, and route to the appropriate model tier. This is programmatic data retrieval, not vector search
— the data is structured and relational.
For production resilience, LiteLLM provides a unified API across providers with automatic retries, exponential
backoff, and provider fallback chains LiteLLM
(Claude Sonnet → GPT-4o → Claude Haiku → pre-computed
fallback). Privacy concerns are minimal — fantasy football league data is low-sensitivity, both providers
contractually commit to not training on API data, and basic data minimization (sending only relevant league
context per request) is sufficient.

Conclusion: a technically sound product with a clear competitive moat
The research validates Fourth Down Labs across all three dimensions. Technical feasibility is high — the
Sleeper API provides complete, free, unauthenticated access to every data point needed for adversarial analysis,
and nflverse supplements it with production-grade NFL statistics. Market validation is strong — Dynasty
Dealmaker proved demand with a viral launch, Dynastydealmaker
but executed shallowly on the core concept.
The gap between "basic owner psychology" and deep multi-season behavioral profiling (FAAB patterns, trade
tendencies, draft modeling, roster-need-aware trade targeting) is the product opportunity. Distribution is
concentrated — 192K members on r/DynastyFF GummySearch
plus 1.5–3M dynasty managers on Sleeper,
reachable through authentic community participation FRANKI T Online Moderation
and a free tier.
The most defensible moat will be the longitudinal behavioral data. Once a user connects their league and Fourth
Down Labs begins tracking multi-season patterns, switching costs rise naturally — no competitor can
retroactively reconstruct that historical analysis. The first product that transforms raw transaction logs into
actionable opponent intelligence will own the "adversarial" category in dynasty fantasy football.
